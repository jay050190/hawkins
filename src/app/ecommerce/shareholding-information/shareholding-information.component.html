                                <p>Hawkins Cookers Limited has been in business since 1959. Today, it has two offices, three factories and about 700 persons working. It is the leader in the pressure cooker market in India and has exported its products since 1974 to various countries in each of the six continents of the world. Hawkins has sold over 105 million pressure cookers and cookware worldwide.
                                 Hawkins pressure cookers are listed by Underwriters Laboratories, USA, an independent Worldwide institution testing products for public safety. From February 1, 2021, the Government of India has made it mandatory to list all Pressure Cookers manufactured and sold in India with the Bureau of Indian Standards, commonly known as ISI. Hence additionally, all Pressure Cookers manufactured by us have certification of BIS and carry the ISI stamp mark too. Each pressure cooker made by Hawkins features an inside fitting lid. This design is inherently safer than conventional pressure cookers. To open any Hawkins cooker, you have to first lower the lid slightly into the body of the cooker; and that cannot be done until the steam pressure inside the cooker falls to a safe level. Thus Hawkins pressure cookers are pressure-locked for safety - like a jetliner door! The Hawkins Company is well known for not compromising on quality and for continual product innovation. The most thorough research and development, the most careful selection of materials, the best manufacturing practices and the strictest quality control - all go into making pressure cookers which are trusted by the millions of families using them. Each cooker is tested to be leak-proof. Along with a superior pressure regulating system, this ensures that Hawkins cooks quickest. Each pressure cooker comes individually packed in an attractive full-colour carton. Cookbooks/Instruction Manuals come free with each pressure cooker. All Hawkins pressure cookers are guaranteed for five years.</p>
