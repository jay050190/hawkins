                                                2. The purpose of The Code is to ensure that Hawkins is in compliance

                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                3. The Code, as detailed herein below in Section B, is applicable to all

                                                Managers and the Company Secretary. Each person to whom The Code is
                                                applicable shall receive a
                                                written notice to that effect along with a copy of The Code and shall be

                                                4. The provisions of the ï¿½Code for Independent Directorsï¿½, as
                                                detailed herein below in
                                                Section C, are additionally applicable to the Independent Directors.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                5. The responsibility for the observance of The Code rests individually
                                                on each person to whom
                                                The Code is applicable and collectively on the Board of Directors of
                                                Hawkins. In addition to
                                                their individual responsibility for the observance of The Code, the
                                                directors carry a collective
                                                responsibility to exercise all due diligence with the purpose of
                                                ensuring that all to whom The
                                                Code is applicable are in compliance with it.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                6. Upon being seized of any matter concerning an alleged contravention
                                                of the Code by a person
                                                to whom it is applicable, the Board of Directors, or any body approved
                                                by them for the purpose,
                                                shall look into all relevant facts and circumstances of the alleged
                                                contravention, giving a
                                                suitable opportunity to the person who is alleged to be in contravention
                                                of The Code to explain
                                                his conduct, reach a determination about the alleged contravention and
                                                decide suitable
                                                corrective action.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                7. The modified Code was considered and adopted by the Board of
                                                Directors of Hawkins at their
                                                meeting held on May 27, 2014, to come into effect on October 1, 2014,
                                                and it replaces the Code
                                                considered and adopted by the Board of Directors of Hawkins at their
                                                meeting held on October 29,
                                                2005, that came into effect on January 1, 2006.

                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                8. The Board of Hawkins has the right and responsibility to suitably
                                                amend The Code from time to
                                                time as may be required by law, changing circumstances or any other
                                                consideration.

                                                        B. The Code</span>
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                1. The conduct of all to whom The Code applies shall be conducive to the
                                                business success of
                                                Hawkins in the long term.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                2. The long term business success of Hawkins requires considerate and
                                                ethical treatment of
                                                customers, suppliers, employees, governmental and regulatory authorities
                                                and shareholders. All
                                                to whom The Code applies shall always act in accordance with this
                                                requirement.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                3. The prime importance given to long term business success does not
                                                mean that we can ignore the
                                                requirement for timely action. All to whom The Code applies must so
                                                manage their work that the
                                                immediate, medium and long term goals of the business are well served.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                4. The separate entity, property and interest of Hawkins as distinct
                                                from the entity, property
                                                and interest of those to whom The Code applies has to be recognised and
                                                respected. In case of
                                                any conflict of interest, all those to whom The Code applies must act to
                                                protect the interest of
                                                Hawkins. In case of any doubt, the matter must be referred up the chain
                                                of command.

                                                5. In case anyone to whom The Code applies perceives a problem of
                                                conflict of interest or ethics
                                                in his superior or in anyone else to whom The Code applies, he is
                                                required to report the facts
                                                which form the basis of his apprehension to his superior's superior (if
                                                the superior is the
                                                object of suspicion) or, in other cases, to his superior.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                6. All those to whom The Code applies must ensure that all operations
                                                under their charge in or
                                                of Hawkins are in compliance with the law.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                7. The financial, physical and intellectual property of Hawkins must be
                                                protected suitably at
                                                all times and only used with proper authority in the interest of
                                                Hawkins.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                8. Confidentiality of the know-how, processes and operations of Hawkins
                                                must be maintained and
                                                all due diligence exercised to ensure that there is no inadvertent or
                                                deliberate breach of the
                                                requirement of confidentiality. The requirement of confidentiality
                                                applies to all documents on
                                                paper or in an electronic form that are labelled as such, all drawings,
                                                diagrams, process charts
                                                and the like in any form whatsoever, all conversations or discussions
                                                the content of which may
                                                assist existing or potential competitors or tend to bring Hawkins into
                                                disrepute, provided that
                                                any disclosure required by law shall not be regarded as a breach of this
                                                requirement.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                9. All relevant aspects of a recommendation or decision have to be
                                                thought through before the
                                                recommendation or the decision is taken. Past precedent, available data
                                                and future effects have
                                                to be considered. The degree of detail to which any matter is looked
                                                into has to be appropriate
                                                to the subject and its potential for future good or harm to the company.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                10. The requirement for thoughtful decisions does not excuse inordinate
                                                delay. The manager has
                                                either to give a decision on the spot or to indicate a reasonable period
                                                of time in which the
                                                decision will be given and then keep to that commitment. The manager has
                                                to either take a
                                                decision himself or to refer it upwards with sufficient data on which a
                                                decision may be taken
                                                with a clear recommendation.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                11. The manager has not merely to respond to instructions but also to
                                                take action on his own
                                                initiative in the company's interest. Policies and procedures are to be
                                                followed but not
                                                unthinkingly. The manager has to continually be on the look out for
                                                possible improvements.
                                                Changes have to be implemented after consultation with all concerned in
                                                Hawkins. Unresolved
                                                conflicts of opinion have to be referred up the organisation for
                                                determination at the
                                                appropriate level.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                12. Meticulous planning, briefing, coordination and monitoring are
                                                required to ensure the
                                                implementation of decisions which is the prime responsibility of the
                                                head of the function. The
                                                head must know when and with whom to put instructions in writing and
                                                when and with whom to rely
                                                on oral instructions, understanding that his responsibility for
                                                implementation is undiluted in
                                                either case.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                13. It is a business requirement and the desired managerial culture in
                                                Hawkins that managers at
                                                all levels are encouraged to speak their minds freely without fear or
                                                favour on all issues
                                                concerning the business and in the interest of Hawkins. Toadyism,
                                                currying favour, office
                                                politics and groupism are to be eschewed and discouraged. The continuing
                                                search for better ways
                                                of working, the exercise of initiative, responsiveness to internal
                                                clients and external
                                                customers, mutual cooperation and teamwork are to be adopted and
                                                encouraged, always provided
                                                that all such efforts are in the interest of Hawkins.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                14. The free expression of opinion and the exercise of initiative has to
                                                coexist with and be
                                                subject to the requirements of managerial discipline. Once decisions are
                                                taken at the
                                                appropriate level after full and free discussion of the issues involved,
                                                the decisions have to
                                                be implemented faithfully and vigorously regardless of anyone's
                                                individual opinion in the
                                                matter. At the same time, the decision makers have to be kept suitably
                                                informed of the results
                                                of the implementation so that corrective action may be taken if any is
                                                required.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                15. Managers are expected to act within the levels of authority
                                                delegated to them and to refer
                                                upwards matters which exceed their authority. In exceptional
                                                circumstances, however, managers
                                                may act beyond their level of authority if in their opinion the delay
                                                caused by a reference
                                                upwards would significantly prejudice the interest of Hawkins, provided
                                                the manager informs his
                                                superior as soon as possible about the action taken by him/her and the
                                                circumstances that
                                                necessitated the immediate action. Thereafter, the immediate action
                                                taken and the circumstances
                                                that purportedly compelled it would be reviewed at an appropriate level
                                                and the manager would be
                                                advised suitably.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                16. The development of subordinates is a corporate requirement. A fair
                                                and firm approach is
                                                required. Subordinates have to be developed by example, by controlled
                                                exposure to greater
                                                responsibility, by challenging of their faculties in on-the-job
                                                discussion and training
                                                programmes and by appraisals and counselling.

                                                17. Record management is an important requirement of corporate
                                                governance. Records have to be
                                                maintained securely for the legally or otherwise required periods or, in
                                                some cases, in
                                                perpetuity. After the required period for any record is over, it has to

                                <p>Hawkins Cookers Limited has been in business since 1959. Today, it has two offices, three factories and about 700 persons working. It is the leader in the pressure cooker market in India and has exported its products since 1974 to various coundiv class="row"ies in each of the six continents of the world. Hawkins has sold over 105 million pressure cookers and cookware worldwide.
                                 Hawkins pressure cookers are listed by Underwriters Laboratories, USA, an independent Worldwide institution testing products for public safety. From February 1, 2021, the Government of India has made it mandatory to list all Pressure Cookers manufactured and sold in India with the Bureau of Indian Standards, commonly known as ISI. Hence additionally, all Pressure Cookers manufactured by us have certification of BIS and carry the ISI stamp mark too. Each pressure cooker made by Hawkins features an inside fitting lid. This design is inherently safer than conventional pressure cookers. To open any Hawkins cooker, you have to first lower the lid slightly into the body of the cooker; and that cannot be done until the steam pressure inside the cooker falls to a safe level. Thus Hawkins pressure cookers are pressure-locked for safety - like a jetliner door! The Hawkins Company is well known for not compromising on quality and for continual product innovation. The most thorough research and development, the most careful selection of materials, the best manufacturing practices and the sdiv class="row"ictest quality condiv class="row"ol - all go into making pressure cookers which are div class="row"usted by the millions of families using them. Each cooker is tested to be leak-proof. Along with a superior pressure regulating system, this ensures that Hawkins cooks quickest. Each pressure cooker comes individually packed in an atdiv class="row"active full-colour carton. Cookbooks/Insdiv class="row"uction Manuals come free with each pressure cooker. All Hawkins pressure cookers are guaranteed for five years.</p>
